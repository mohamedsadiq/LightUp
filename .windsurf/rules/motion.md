# Family Wallet Animation Principles

## Core Rules
- Always apply the Three Pillars: Simplicity, Fluidity, Delight
- Keep animations under 300ms for frequent interactions
- Use spring physics for natural movement
- Respect reduced motion preferences
- Never animate just for the sake of it

## Validation Rules
- Every animation must serve a purpose (feedback, guidance, delight, clarity)
- Apply Delight-Impact Curve based on usage frequency
- Ensure component continuity (no duplication)
- Test performance on target devices
- Use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)

## Implementation Rules
- Use the provided animation configs from the guide
- Follow the copy-paste templates for consistency
- Implement accessibility checks
- Test with real users before deployment
